Bordermodels would like to invite photographers to do free creative test shoots with aspiring models.<br><br>Lighting or mood tests, creative or artistic experiments, working out a concept or theme… we have a selection of new and upcoming talent that is eager to work with you on your projects. </p>

<p>We see this as a win-win for everyone involved; photographers can work with the models of tomorrow today - for free, and models get to gain experience, work on their book and learn from the creative minds that shape our industry.</p>

<p>This offer is also for student photographers or filmmakers, as they are tomorrow’s talent and we firmly believe in investing time and effort in upcoming generations.</p>
